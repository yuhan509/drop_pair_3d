In this project 220104, we focus on implementing rotate the grid's pole to a point A at each time step.
A is the closest point on the surface to the coordinate origin (0,0,0).

The rotation is done after marching by mid point rule. So there is no rotation in the middle step.

Add iflag to close_dist.
